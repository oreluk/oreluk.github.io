I am a Senior Algorithm & Validation Engineer at Joby Aviation, focusing on uncertainty quantification, probabilistic modeling, and optimal decision making. Previously, I worked at Sandia National Laboratories developing Bayesian optimal experimental designs for complex physics-based models. I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley, co-advised by Michael Frenklach and Andy Packard. I also hold a BS in mechanical engineering from the University of Illinois at Chicago.
