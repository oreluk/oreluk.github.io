I am a postdoctoral researcher at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA. My main area of research focuses on the development and application of uncertainty quantification and machine learning techniques, with a recent emphasis on optimal decision making. I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley, where I was co-advised by Michael Frenklach and Andy Packard, and I also have a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago.
