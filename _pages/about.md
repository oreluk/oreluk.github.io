I am a postdoctoral researcher at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore, CA. My work primarily focuses on uncertainty quantification, machine learning, and optimal decision making. I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley, where I was co-advised by Michael Frenklach and Andy Packard, and I also have a BS from University of Illinois at Chicago.
