I am a Senior Algorithm & Validation Engineer at Joby Aviation. My research has been focused on uncertainty quantification, probablistic modeling, and optimal decision making. Previously, I work at Sandia National Laboratories, where I developing optimal experimental designs for complex physics-based models. I earned my PhD in mechanical engineering from UC Berkeley, where I was co-advised by Michael Frenklach and Andy Packard, and I also have a BS in mechanical engineering from University of Illinois at Chicago.
